# Snake Game

## Overview
A simple **Snake Game** implemented using Python and Pygame. The player controls a snake that grows longer by eating food and must avoid colliding with walls or itself. The game keeps track of the player's score, which is based on the length of the snake.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Move the snake using the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
- **Food Collection**: The snake eats food that randomly spawns on the screen and grows longer.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake hits the wall or collides with its own body.
- **Score Tracking**: The score is displayed dynamically and is based on the snake's length.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
